      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, âand what is the use of a book,â thought Alice\n",
      "âwithout pictures or conversations?â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, âOh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled âORANGE MARMALADEâ, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell!â thought Alice to herself, âafter such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldnât say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!â (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? âI wonder how\n",
      "many miles Iâve fallen by this time?â she said aloud. âI must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I thinkââ (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) ââyes, thatâs about the right distanceâbut\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâve got to?â (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. âI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny itâll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkââ (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnât sound at all\n",
      "the right word) ââbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Maâam, is this New Zealand or Australia?â\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâfancy _curtseying_ as youâre\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) âAnd what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl sheâll think me for asking! No, itâll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. âDinahâll miss me very much to-night, I should think!â\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) âI hope theyâll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n",
      "no mice in the air, Iâm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâs\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â And here\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, âDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â and\n",
      "sometimes, âDo bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer\n",
      "either question, it didnât much matter which way she put it. She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "âNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\n",
      "it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, âOh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late itâs getting!â She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâs\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; âand even if my head would go through,â thought\n",
      "poor Alice, âit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\n",
      "knew how to begin.â For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",
      "happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (âwhich certainly was not here\n",
      "before,â said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words âDRINK ME,â beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say âDrink me,â but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do _that_ in a hurry. âNo, Iâll look first,â she said,\n",
      "âand see whether itâs marked â_poison_â or notâ; for she had read\n",
      "several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\n",
      "eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n",
      "_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\n",

      "\n",

      "flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\n",
      "hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, âMouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",

      "it muttering to itself âThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! Sheâll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?â Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seenâeverything seemed to have changed since\n",
      "her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\n",
      "little door, had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, âWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\n",
      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!â And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",
      "at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\n",
      "mistake it had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHe took me for his housemaid,â she said to herself as she ran. âHow\n",
      "surprised heâll be when he finds out who I am! But Iâd better take him\n",
      "his fan and glovesâthat is, if I can find them.â As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name âW. RABBIT,â engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "âHow queer it seems,â Alice said to herself, âto be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâll be sending me on messages next!â And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ââMiss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!â âComing in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But Iâve got to see that the mouse doesnât get out.â Only I\n",
      "donât think,â Alice went on, âthat theyâd let Dinah stop in the house\n",
      "if it began ordering people about like that!â\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words âDRINK ME,â but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. âI know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,â she said to herself, âwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "Iâll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itâll make me grow large\n",
      "again, for really Iâm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!â\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself âThatâs quite enoughâI hope I shanât\n",
      "grow any moreâAs it is, I canât get out at the doorâI do wish I hadnât\n",
      "drunk quite so much!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself âNow I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was much pleasanter at home,â thought poor Alice, âwhen one wasnât\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-holeâand yetâand\n",
      "yetâitâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, Iâll write oneâbut Iâm grown up now,â she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; âat least thereâs no room to grow up any more _here_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one wayânever to be an old womanâbut\n",
      "thenâalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like _that!_â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh, you foolish Alice!â she answered herself. âHow can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, thereâs hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!â\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",
      "making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\n",
      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMary Ann! Mary Ann!â said the voice. âFetch me my gloves this moment!â\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Aliceâs elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself âThen Iâll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.â\n",
      "\n",
      "â_That_ you wonât!â thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voiceâthe RabbitâsââPat! Pat! Where are you?â And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, âSure then Iâm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDigging for apples, indeed!â said the Rabbit angrily. âHere! Come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_â (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow tell me, Pat, whatâs that in the window?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSure, itâs an arm, yer honour!â (He pronounced it âarrum.â)\n",
      "\n",
      "âAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSure, it does, yer honour: but itâs an arm for all that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, itâs got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, âSure, I donât like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!â âDo as I tell you, you coward!â and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. âWhat a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!â thought Alice. âI wonder what\n",
      "theyâll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ Iâm sure _I_ donât want to stay in here any longer!â\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: âWhereâs the other\n",
      "ladder?âWhy, I hadnât to bring but one; Billâs got the otherâBill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!âHere, put âem up at this cornerâNo, tie âem\n",
      "together firstâthey donât reach half high enough yetâOh! theyâll do\n",
      "well enough; donât be particularâHere, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "ropeâWill the roof bear?âMind that loose slateâOh, itâs coming down!\n",
      "Heads below!â (a loud crash)ââNow, who did that?âIt was Bill, I\n",
      "fancyâWhoâs to go down the chimney?âNay, _I_ shanât! _You_ do\n",
      "it!â_That_ I wonât, then!âBillâs to go downâHere, Bill! the master says\n",
      "youâre to go down the chimney!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! So Billâs got to come down the chimney, has he?â said Alice to\n",
      "herself. âShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnât be in\n",
      "Billâs place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I _think_ I can kick a little!â\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal (she couldnât guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself âThis is Bill,â she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of âThere goes Bill!â\n",
      "then the Rabbitâs voice alongââCatch him, you by the hedge!â then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voicesââHold up his headâBrandy\n",
      "nowâDonât choke himâHow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (âThatâs Bill,â thought\n",
      "Alice,) âWell, I hardly knowâNo more, thank ye; Iâm better nowâbut Iâm\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell youâall I know is, something comes at me\n",

      "âSo you did, old fellow!â said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe must burn the house down!â said the Rabbitâs voice; and Alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, âIf you do, Iâll set Dinah at you!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, âI\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyâd take the\n",
      "roof off.â After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, âA barrowful will do, to begin with.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âA barrowful of _what?_â thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. âIâll put a stop to\n",
      "this,â she said to herself, and shouted out, âYouâd better not do that\n",
      "again!â which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. âIf I eat one of these cakes,â she thought, âitâs sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it canât possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe first thing Iâve got to do,â said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, âis to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. âPoor little\n",
      "thing!â said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppyâs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: âI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifâif Iâd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Iâd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "Iâve got to grow up again! Let me seeâhow _is_ it to be managed? I\n",

      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",

      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd now which is which?â she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",

      "\n",

      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",

      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",

      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",

      "question, you know.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. âItâs really\n",

      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",

      "âBut what am _I_ to do?â said Alice.\n",

      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a momentâs pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",

      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the babyâthe fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
